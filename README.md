# Foundations of Operation Reserach Project Small

This project involves developing a maximization algorithm to find a solution regarding a real life problem.

The idea was to understand were to locate biogas plant considering the amount of gas produced and shipment cost.

Utilizing Python's MIP library, the objective was to define constraints and optimize the outcomes.

This is the small project, therefore there are less constraints and no time limit.
